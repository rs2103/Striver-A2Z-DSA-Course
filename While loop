User Task:
Your task is to complete the provided function and print the table in reverse order (with space between the values).
NOTE: As the code is checked against multiple test cases, the new line is necessary after every execution and the template code has taken care of that.
Example 1:

Input:
1

Output:
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
//User function Template for Java
class Geeks {
	 static void printTable (int n) 
	 {
            int multiplier=10;
            while(multiplier>0)
            {
                //Your code here
                int i = n* multiplier;
                System.out.print(i+" ");
                multiplier--;
            }
       System.out.println();
	 }

}
