Find all factorial numbers less than or equal to n

Examples:
Input: n = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 
1 which is less than equal to n. The second 
number is 2 which is less than equal to n,
but the third factorial number is 6 which 
is greater than n. So we print only 1 and 2.

class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Long> factorialNumbers(long n) {
        ArrayList<Long> result = new ArrayList<>();
        generateFactorials(1,1,n,result);
        return result;
    }
    static void generateFactorials(long i, long factorial, long n,  ArrayList<Long> result){
        if(factorial > n){
            return;
        }
        result.add(factorial);
        generateFactorials(i+1,factorial*(i+1),n,result);
    }
}
