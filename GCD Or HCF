LCM And GCD
Example 1:

Input:
A = 5 , B = 10
Output:
10 5
Explanation:
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while
thier GCD is 5.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function lcmAndGcd() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a List of two Integers, the required LCM and GCD.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    static Long[] lcmAndGcd(Long A , Long B) {
        // code here
        Long gcd = calculateGCD(A, B);
        Long lcm = (A * B) / gcd;
        return new Long[]{lcm, gcd};
    }
    
    static Long calculateGCD(Long a, Long b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return a;
        return calculateGCD(b, a % b);
    }
    
}
