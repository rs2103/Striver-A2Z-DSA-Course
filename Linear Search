Searching an element in a sorted array
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, K = 6
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,6}
Output: 1
Exlpanation: Since, 6 is present in 
the array at index 4 (0-based indexing),
output is 1.
 
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5, K = 2
arr[] = {1,3,4,5,6}
Output: -1
Exlpanation: Since, 2 is not present 
in the array, output is -1.
 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function searchInSorted() which takes the sorted array arr[], its size N and the element K as input parameters and 
returns 1 if K is present in the array, else it returns -1. 

class Solution{
    static int searchInSorted(int arr[], int N, int K)
    {
        
        // Your code here
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            if(arr[i] == K){
                return 1 ;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
