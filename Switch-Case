Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function switchCase() which takes choice and a list arr[], containing the single value R or the two values L and B, as input parameters. It should return the area of the desired geometrical figure.

Note: Use Math.PI for the value of pi.
Example 1:

Input: 
choice = 1, 
R = 5
Output: 78.53981633974483
Explaination: The choice is 1. 
So we have to calculate the area of the circle.
Example 2:

Input: 
choice = 2, 
L = 5, B = 10
Output: 50
Explaination: Here we have to calculate the 
area of the rectangle.

class Solution{
    static double switchCase(int choice, List<Double> arr){
        // code here
        double area = 0.0;
        switch(choice) {
            case 1:
                double R = arr.get(0);
                area = Math.PI * R * R;
                break;
            case 2:
                double L = arr.get(0);
                double B = arr.get(1);
                area = L*B;
                break;
            default:
                return -1;
        }
        return area;
    }
}
